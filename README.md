# Zumers Cake

This is a Next.js project for Zumers Cake.


## Project Description and Features

Zumers Cake is a Next.js application designed to showcase custom cakes and allow users to place orders.

Here's a breakdown of its features:

- **Homepage (`/`)**: This is the landing page featuring a hero image, a catchy slogan, and a brief introduction to Zumers Cake. It includes calls to action to explore the "Gallery" and "Create Order" sections. There's also a "Our Story" section with a link to the "About" page.

- **Gallery (`/gallery`)**: This section displays various cake designs, likely categorized. Users can browse through different types of cakes (e.g., "Cupcake & Cake Pop", "Birthday", "Cookies", "Special Day") to get inspiration.

- **Order (`/order`)**: This feature allows users to create custom cake orders. This likely includes options for selecting cake type, size, flavors, and potentially uploading reference photos.

- **About (`/about`)**: This page provides more information about the Zumers Cake story, philosophy, and background.

- **Contact (`/contact`)**: This section likely provides a way for users to get in touch with Zumers Cake, perhaps through a contact form.

- **API Endpoints**: The project includes API routes for `send` and `upload`. The `upload` endpoint handles photo uploads, likely for custom order requests, and the `send` endpoint could be for submitting order details or contact form submissions.
